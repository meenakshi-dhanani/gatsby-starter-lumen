Hello there! Meena here; I'm from India. I'm a full stack engineer that has dabbled with developer relations over the past few years. My current area of focus is GraphQL. I adore React, am terrible at CSS,  and enjoy being on stage and in front of the camera.

In my spare time, I enjoy mentoring and teaching computer science and coding, contributing to open source, doing 1000-piece puzzles, working out, and practising yoga.Â
